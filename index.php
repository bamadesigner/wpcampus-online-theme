		<h2>A Virtual Conference for WordPress in Higher Education</h2>

		<p>Couldn’t make it to Sarasota this year for <a href="https://2016.wpcampus.org/">WPCampus 2016</a>? Is your budget tight for travel and conferences for 2017? Do you still want to experience WordPress sessions, expertise, and networking with users across the world without the expense and hassle of travel?</p>

		<p>If this sounds right up your alley, be sure to mark your calendar for an "all day" virtual event on Monday, January 23, 2017 and join the WPCampus community for an entire day of education and professional development. No travel required!</p>

		<div class="panel" style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">WPCampus is proud to introduce <strong>WPCampus Online</strong>!</span><br />Our inaugural virtual conference scheduled for <strong>Monday, January 23, 2017</strong>.</div>

		<p>WPCampus Online is a virtual conference that will provide multiple WordPress tracks, great speakers, easy-to-use technology, and opportunities to network and connect with colleagues. <strong>This virtual event will be supplemental to, and not a replacement for, our in-person conference.</strong> The more options for development the better!</p>

		<p>There will not be a physical location for WPCampus Online. The event will be completely online and speakers will broadcast from their individual locations. Attendees will view sessions via live streaming and be able to interact with the speakers, and other attendees, through chat.</p>

		<p>Our call for speakers is not limited to those who work in higher ed as we believe you do not have to be in higher education to bring value to our community.
